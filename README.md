# Customer Care Center

This project consists of customer service management where you can choose the right one personal who will solve your main problem. After select one, you have to fill 2 gaps with your personal information to receive an E-mail with all data of the user you have chosen.

## API Reference
In this case i decided to use an API to get all information about the users

Here is the API --> [JSONPLACEHOLDER](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)

## Routes:

#### Get all Users

```http
  GET /
```

#### Get a particular User

```http
  GET /${id}
```

#### Send an E-mail 

```http
  POST /${id}
```

## SendGrid

This is the platform i have used to send emails to a particular email box
